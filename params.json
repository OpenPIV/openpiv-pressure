Since the flow is fully described \r\nby the vector field of velocity (the direct result of PIV) and the scalar field of pressure (the main unknown part), if \r\nwe had a trustable method to extract pressure from PIV results, it would cause literally a breakthrough in many areas of \r\nour life. \r\n\r\nBack in 1999, we suggested to use PIV data in a single plane and apply to the derivatives of velocity the Poisson \r\nequation. Upon accurate boundary conditions and high quality PIV measurements it is possible to get the fluctuating (!) and \r\nthe mean pressure fields. \r\n\r\n### References\r\n* Our original blog post: http://urapiv.wordpress.com/projects/pressure/\r\n* the scanned conference manuscript in this repository under /docs/ or here [PDF](http://urapiv.files.wordpress.com/2006/02/PIV_99_paper_OCR.pdf)\r\nor here [PDF](http://www.academia.edu/2760232/Computation_of_pressure_distribution_using_PIV_velocity_data)\r\n* If you use this code and the ideas, please cite:  \r\n\r\n      Gurka R., Liberzon A., Hefetz D., Rubinstein D. and Shavit U., Computation of Pressure Distribution Using PIV Velocity Data, 3rd International Workshop on Particle Image Velocimetry, Santa Barbara, California, September 16-18, 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
